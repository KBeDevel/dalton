# Dalton

The atomic-oriented code editor

This repository is a fork of the amazing and (sadly) deprecated the electron-based code editor, [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom).

This is an experimental and small project oriented to provide a lightweight code editor focused on modularity and performance.
